    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">Ah, I see that you thinking about the little turtle friend here, Squirtle. She is usually well behaved, yet it has an underlying rebellious streak. It has large, purplish or reddish eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet have three pointed digits. The end of its long tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves.. I pretty sure as a Trainer you already know this right? She is a clever girl with much resourcefulness. </p>
    <p class="text_column"> its aerodynamic shape and grooved surface, Squirtle's shell helps it wade through the water very quickly. It also offers protection in battle. Like turtles, Squirtle has a shell that covers its body with holes that allow its limbs, tail, and head to be exposed. Unlike a turtle, Squirtle is ordinarily bipedal. She has the moves Tailwhip and Tackle, I think. Best move it can learn is Hydro Pump. Wartortle is the next step in her evolution. Having to develope sharper and larger claws and teeth than Squirtle, making it a much more worthy partner. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Their tails are larger and fluffier than that of a Squirtle's. The fur on Wartortle's tail darkens with age. Wartortle have developed large furry ears. Like its pre-evolved form, it can also use its shell to protect itself. Final, we have Blastoise for Squirtle's adult form.  Similar to those of its pre-evolved forms It is now noticeably bulkier than its previous evolutions.has large, water cannons that are located on the top left and right sides. The water that comes out of the cannons is capable of punching holes through thick steel. </p>

      <h3>LOCATION</h3>
      <img src="Images/kanto_map.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="cards"/>
      <p>Kanto lies to the east of Johto; they presumably make up a small continent. To the south of Kanto are the Sevii and Orange Islands. Hoenn, introduced in Pokémon is supposedly further to the southwest. Routes located wholly within Kanto are numbered 1 to 25; routes 26, 27, and 28 connect Kanto with Johto. Supposedly to the north of this continent is the Sinnoh region. Unova is in a considerable distance away and it's unknown where both it and Kalos are in relation to Kanto.</p>
