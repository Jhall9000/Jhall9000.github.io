    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">So your thinking of choosing Charmander, the "Lizard" type Pokémon. With his flamed tail and his courage to stand with one trainer just as burning, who wouldn't like the tyke. This little Charmander I hatch from an egg myself. He only knows Scratch and Growl for now, but give it time. Maybe with enough training and patient, he will learn many good and strong moves. Flamethrower is the their favorite move they like learn. You should know that when you take care of Charmander, don't let his flame on his tail die out. It is said that Charmander dies if its flame goes out. </p>
    <p class="text_column"> The flame can be used as an indication of Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pokémon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. However, if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain. Charmander is the unevoled form of Charizard, Thus a baby or child of that Pokémon. Then if you train charmander enough, then you get Charmeleon, a much darker red skin color, a larger body structure, claws, and a horn-like protrusion version of Charmander. </p>
    <p class="text_column"> From that to Charizard is a large, dragon-like Pokémon that differs greatly from its pre-evolved form. The red skin coloration of Charmeleon is no longer apparent, as Charizard appears to have reverted back to the orange/yellow coloration of Charmander. The single horn that was on the back of its head is now two, one on either side. The most notable difference between Charizard and its pre-evolved forms are the large wings that have developed on its back, which gives Charizard the capability of flying.  </p>

      <h3>LOCATION</h3>
      <img src="Images/kanto_map.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="cards"/>
      <p>Kanto lies to the east of Johto; they presumably make up a small continent. To the south of Kanto are the Sevii and Orange Islands. Hoenn, introduced in Pokémon is supposedly further to the southwest. Routes located wholly within Kanto are numbered 1 to 25; routes 26, 27, and 28 connect Kanto with Johto. Supposedly to the north of this continent is the Sinnoh region. Unova is in a considerable distance away and it's unknown where both it and Kalos are in relation to Kanto.</p>
