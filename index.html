    <p class="text_column">Hello there youngster! Welcome to the world of pokémon! My name is Professor Oak. People have often refered to me as the Pokémon Professor. I see that your finally ready to leave Pallet town to become a Pokémon Trainer with that determined look.Reminds me of my days as a Trainer. As you can tell, this world is inhabited by creatures called Pokémon. For some people, Pokémon are pets. Others use them for fights. Myself...I study Pokémon as a profession. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Your mother told me that you were heading over here to say your good-bye to me. I have a better idea that can kill two Spearows with one stone. Instead why don't you take this Pokedex. It's one of my greatest achievements! It's an electronic device designed to catalogue and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon. An encyclopedia for Trainers and many others who are passionate about Pokémon as I am. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Hmm? There is somthing amiss here, but what is it? Ah yes! See that table that has three&nbsp;PokéBalls on it. Your going to need your own Pokémon partner for your journey. My Grandson And one of the neighboring kids took Eevee and Pikachu. I think the kid's name was Ash or Yellow? These days I can't even remeber my Grandson name?! Why don't you choose one of the last three. Remember to choose carefully and wisely. Oh?&nbsp; What's this? you don't know any of these&nbsp;Pokémon?&nbsp; Well, let me help you with that.</p>

      <p>Professor Oak is a middle aged Pokémon professor with gray hair and sports a light maroon polo shirt underneath his labcoat. He wears a brown belt supporting his beige pants along with matching brown loafers. He lives in Pallet town in the Kanto Region. He pasted away due to a Tyranitar stampede hitting him at full force crossing the streets of Veridian city. </p>

      <h3>LOCATION</h3>
      <img src="Images/kanto_map.jpg" alt="kanto_map" width="800" height="600" class="cards"/>
      <p>Kanto lies to the east of Johto; they presumably make up a small continent. To the south of Kanto are the Sevii and Orange Islands. Hoenn, introduced in Pokémon is supposedly further to the southwest. Routes located wholly within Kanto are numbered 1 to 25; routes 26, 27, and 28 connect Kanto with Johto. Supposedly to the north of this continent is the Sinnoh region. Unova is in a considerable distance away and it's unknown where both it and Kalos are in relation to Kanto.</p>
