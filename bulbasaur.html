    <p class="text_column">Let's talk about Bulbasaur, now that you taken an intrest at look at his PokéBall. Resembling a small, squatting dinosaur that walks on four legs, but bears three claws on each of its feet and has no tail. It also has large, red eyes and very sharp teeth. Its skin is a light, turquoise color with dark, green spots. It has three claws on all four of its legs. Its most notable feature, however, is the aforementioned bulb on its back, which according to the constant research that i undertake with it, was planted there at birth. Bulbasaur has a "bulb" on its back that grows steadily larger as it matures. This bulb contains a seed which uses photosynthesis to supply Bulbasaur with energy. </p>
    <p class="text_column"> Its bulb is also used to store the energy that the seed absorbs, which can be used when it is necessary. It is assumed that when a Bulbasaur collects enough energy in its bulb, it will evolve into an Ivysaur. now speaking about it's next evolution, appearance is very similar to that of its pre-evolved form, Bulbasaur. Ivysaur's top fangs are now larger and are visible outside of the mouth. Also, it becomes a Poison type. Its ears are now darkened to black in the center. Carrying the weight of the bud on its back makes Ivysaur's legs stronger. The most notable change is that the bulb is starting to bloom, with pink petals visible, and large leaves on the bloom bottom. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Let's talk about it's final form, shall we? Venusaur is a large, dinosaur-like Pokémon that is somewhat similar in appearance to its pre-evolved forms, Ivysaur and Bulbasaur. Its skin still retains a light turquoise color, but it no longer has the spots, and it appears more rough and scaly, with bumps here and there. The former bulb on its back has now fully bloomed into a gigantic flower and its ears have lightened up as well. Female Venusaur are slightly different because they have a seed on their back, which shows that it can give birth to a new Bulbasaur. This one is aboy so not to worry. Unless you wanted a female, then that's also good too. </p>

      <h3>LOCATION</h3>
      <img src="Images/kanto_map.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="cards"/>
      <p>Kanto lies to the east of Johto; they presumably make up a small continent. To the south of Kanto are the Sevii and Orange Islands. Hoenn, introduced in Pokémon is supposedly further to the southwest. Routes located wholly within Kanto are numbered 1 to 25; routes 26, 27, and 28 connect Kanto with Johto. Supposedly to the north of this continent is the Sinnoh region. Unova is in a considerable distance away and it's unknown where both it and Kalos are in relation to Kanto.</p>
